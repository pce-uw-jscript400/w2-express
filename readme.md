# Building Servers with Express

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to build a simple server with the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework for Node.js.

## Core Learning Objective

*	Create an application server using NodeJS and Express

## Sub-Objectives

* Create an Express server that listens on a specified port
* Make requests to that server using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com)
* Create routes using different paths and HTTP verbs
* Identify and build middleware
* Parse information sent in the request body

### Installation

1. Fork & Clone
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`

Then, go to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000) and you should see a message.

### Instructions & Guiding Questions

- [ ] Take a look at the `.gitignore` file.

* **Question:** Why do you think `node_modules/` is included in there?

* **Your Answer:** You don't need to track changes for node modules as they _shouldn't_ be changing. Node packages are readily available via NPM and therefore are not required to be packaged with your code. Running `npm install` will download and install all required dependencies for your project. Also, the contents of node_modules are generally only necessary for the development and build portion of the application development, not required as as assets for the production codebase. Finally, the node_modules folder can very quickly become bloated and storage resource intensive, making it more effective to install those dependencies separately.

- [ ] Take a look at the `package.json` file.

* **Question:** Take a minute to look through the installed packages and describe the purpose of each one. Don't just copy and paste from something online!

* **Your Answer:** Body parser appears to parse response data. Express is a simple javascript server library for serving files from a Node backend. Morgan is a testing framework. Nodemon appears to be a task runner.

---

- [ ] Try going to [http://localhost:5000/notfound](http://localhost:5000/notfound)

* **Question:** Why do we get a response when we go to `/` but not `/notfound`?

* **Your Answer:** The route `/notfound` has not been defined so it returns status code 404.

---

- [ ] By default, browsers make `GET` requests when you go to a URL. Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to make a similar `GET` request.

---

- [ ] In Postman, go to the **Headers** tab _that is on the same level as the response Body._ These are headers that were returned by your server.

* **Question:** What are headers? What values do you recognize?

* **Your Answer:** Headers are like meta data information about the request. I recognize Content-Type, content-length and date as being fairly standard parameters. 

---

- [ ] Add the following line **above** the `res.json()` line in your `app.js` file; then, make the request again.
  ```js
  console.log(req.headers)
  ```

* **Question:** Where can you find this `console.log()` statement? How can you change the headers that are sent in Postman?

* **Your Answer:** The console log can be viewed in the terminal. To change the headers being sent, you can add custom values in the `Headers` tab right below the URL entry field. 

---

- [ ] Add the following line **above** the `res.json()` line in your `app.js` file; then, make a request again but this time change the URL to the following: `http://localhost:5000?course=javascript`
  ```js
  console.log(req.query)
  ```

* **Question:** What are query parameters? Try going to a couple of your favorite websites and paste an example of query parameters being used.

* **Your Answer:** Query parameters are key:value pairs entered into the URL. The Starbucks PWA uses query parameters on sign in to indicate what URL you were referred to and should therefore be returned to. ex: `https://app.starbucks.com/account/signin?ReturnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.starbucks.com%2F`

---

- [ ] Before all of your routes, add the following:
  ```js
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('In the server!')
    next()
  })
  ```

* **Question:** When does `app.use()` get called?

* **Your Answer:** When a request is made and in the order of operations in the script. If it comes after a matching requested route, the code would not fire. 

---

- [ ] Take a moment to observe the basic structure of a **route** in Express.
  ```js
  app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(req.query)
    res.json({
      message: 'Hello, Express!'
    })
  })
  ```

* **Question:** What type of thing is `app` and what is its purpose?

* **Your Answer:** App is a function and its various attached methods referencing the Express module. 

* **Question:** What type of thing is `app.get()` and what is its purpose?

* **Your Answer:** It is a function and it defines a route and the callback function to handle the request and response parameters. 

* **Question:** What type of thing is `/` and what is its purpose?

* **Your Answer:** `/` is a string representing a route. This is the specified url where the request will be made. 

* **Question:** What type of thing is `req` and what does it represent in the callback?

* **Your Answer:** It is the request object. It references the parameters included in the the request for the route (headers, query parameters, etc)

* **Question:** What type of thing is `res` and what does it represent in the callback?

* **Your Answer:** it is the response object. It is what is returned from the request. 

* **Question:** What type of thing is `next` and what does it represent in the callback?

* **Your Answer:** it is a function that informs the application to continue running the application to find the next available matching route.

* **Question:** Instead of a `GET` request, lets say we want to listen in for a `POST` request. What do you think you needs to change?

* **Your Answer:** change `app.get()` to `app.post()`

* **Question:** Right now all of our requests will return a "Status Code" of 200. Define what a status code is and research how you could change it.

* **Your Answer:** a status code indicates the whether a request was successful or not and a reason for that status. you can set a request status code by returning `res.status(__code__)`

---

- [ ] Add the following route to your application; then, make a request again but this time change the URL to the following, making sure to replace `<your-name` with your acutal name: `http://localhost:5000/my/name/is/<your-name>`.
  ```js
  app.get('/my/name/is/:name', (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(req.params)
    res.json({
      message: `Hello, ${req.params.name}!`
    })
  })
  ```

* **Question:** What is `req.params`? What else will you need to change if you change the path to `/my/name/is/:username`?

* **Your Answer:** It is the request parameters object. If it was changed to `:username` the template string would have to be updated to `${req.params.username}`.

---

- [ ] Create three new routes as follows, testing each one as you go:
  ```
  GET /ping
  -> Status Code: 200
  -> Response Body: { message: 'pong' }

  POST /message?content=hello
  -> Status Code: 201
  -> Response Body: { message: 'Message received!', content: 'hello' }

  DELETE /messages/4
  -> Status Code: 200
  -> Response Body: { message: 'Deleted message 4' }
  ```

---

- [ ] Earlier we added the following code. Try moving it between two routes you just created and test each route.
  ```js
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('In the server!')
    next()
  })
  ```

* **Question:** The above can be described as middleware. Describe what middleware is in your own words and how it differs from building a route.

* **Your Answer:** Middleware is like a utility or helper for processessing requests. A route is an endpoint a client can make a request to. That endpoint would likely use that middleware to help process said request.

---

- [ ] Take a moment to read through the following code that is already in `app.js`. If you need, take a look at the [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) and [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) packages on NPM:
  ```js
  if (NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    app.use(require('morgan')('dev'))
  }
  app.use(require('body-parser').json())
  ```

* **Question:** Describe the purpose of both morgan and body-parser. Why do you think morgan is only being run when the application is run in development mode?

* **Your Answer:** Morgan is a logging utility for monitoring the requests made to the server. Body parser is a utility for processing response objects as json. Morgan is only run in development mode because it wouldn't serve much purpose in a production environment. Rarely would a developer need realtime logging of the requests not to mention it could have unintended performance impact.

---

- [ ] Update one of the `POST` routes you've created by adding the following code before the response is set. Then, try sending a request body using Postman to that route.
  ```js
  console.log(req.body)
  ```

* **Question:** Try commenting out `body-parser` in your application. What happens and why?

* **Your Answer:** Nothing was logged. This is likely because the response object has not been properly handled or parsed.

---

- [ ] Visit the [Exercise: Express](https://github.com/pce-uw-jscript400/exercise-express) repository on GitHub. Follow the setup instructions and open the code in a code editor. Then, answer the following questions:

* **Question:** Describe what is happening on the following line. What is the [shortid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shortid) package and what is it being used for?
  ```js
  const { generate: generateId } = require('shortid')
  ```

* **Your Answer:** This line imports the shortid module and more specifically the generate() method as the named function  generateId. This package can be used to quickly generate random unique IDs.

* **Question:** What routes are currently available to you as part of this application?

* **Your Answer:** GET and POST to `/vegetables` and a GET route for `/vegetables/:id`

* **Question:** Look for `helpers.validate` in the `app.js` file. What is this and how does it work?

* **Your Answer:** It is a middleware function that is checking the request object for the two required valid object keys, no extras. 

* **Question:** Try creating a new vegetable. Then, try restarting your server. What happens to the data you posted and why?

* **Your Answer:** The posted data no longer exists. It is gone because it was only posted to the local memory. Once that is cleared on restart, it it lost forever.

* **Question:** Take a look at the last two `app.use()` methods at the end of the file. Describe how both work and what `err` is refers to.

* **Your Answer:** The first of the two is essentially middleware to handle undefined routes. in the response object, it sets the status as 404 and generates a message that the request could not be made. The second `app.use()` is the error handler for the unhandled route.

* **Question:** Take a look at the `package.json` file. What is [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) and what will it do for you?

* **Your Answer:** Standardjs is a javascript linter that will check your code for errors and formatting issues.
